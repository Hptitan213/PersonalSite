                           <p>It was my privilege to work with Robert at Blueprint Consulting, building a brand new technical support program for Valve Software. Confronted with severe customer satisfaction difficulties after the unforeseen expansion of their Steam gaming platform, Valve partnered with Blueprint Consulting in 2015 to handle an extraordinary backlog of support tickets.

Right from the start, Robert was instrumental in making this new team successful. He maintained high morale, motivated his peers, and drove this rapidly growing team to eliminate a huge support backlog well ahead of schedule and restore Valve’s reputation.

I joined this team four months after Robert, and he immediately distinguished himself as an exceptional technical resource and mentor for me, as we worked to design the processes and tools for knowledge, quality, training, recruitment, workforce, ticket and people management that were necessary to keep this new team successful for the long term.

Robert is a trusted adviser and pivotal teammate, always eager to share knowledge, gather feedback from all sources, learn as much as he can, set a great example for his peers and drive for excellence. I highly recommend Robert and hope to work with him again.</p>
